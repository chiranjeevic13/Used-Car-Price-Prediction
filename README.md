Car Price Prediction Project
This project is a web application that predicts car prices based on various features using machine learning models. It is built using FastAPI for the API framework and Scikit-learn for model training.

Features
Predicts car prices based on input features.
REST API using FastAPI for predictions.
Supports multiple machine learning models.
Requirements
Python 3.7+
FastAPI
Uvicorn
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Steps/Responsibilities
Data Collection: Gather and preprocess car data, including features such as model, year, mileage, and more.
Model Training: Train different machine learning models using the preprocessed data to predict car prices.
API Development: Develop API endpoints using FastAPI to serve the predictions.
Testing: Test the API and model predictions to ensure accuracy and reliability.
Deployment: Deploy the application to a suitable environment for end-users to access.
Usage
Access the API at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
Use the /predict endpoint to make predictions by sending car feature details.
